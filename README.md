##Issues
The menu font seems smaller in the site then it does in the mockup.  Its not listed in the style guide so I copied the font listed in Sketch.  In reality I would follow up with the designer.

I wanted the shadow in the png to show at the transition to the How We Met/Proposal section.  But the image changes in order to be responsive.  I ended up adding the green background color under the background image and shaving off the clear part of the image at the top so the green would not show through in the header.  I did not have time to implement a more elegant solution.

The image needs more breakpoints to get it to be full screen more of the time.  

It wasnâ€™t in the style guide, but the line height seems to be greater for the body text in the mockups then on the page.  I stuck to the style guide, but if this were a real assignment, I would check.  

There is no menu on the mobile section, even though an element is referenced in the sketch file.  Same goes for a footer for either section.
